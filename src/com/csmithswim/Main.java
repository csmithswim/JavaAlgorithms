Return the factorial of the provided integer.If the integer is represented with the letter n,
a factorial is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to n.
Factorials are often represented with the shorthand notation n!
For example: 5! = 1 * 2 * 3 * 4 * 5 = 120
factorialize(5) should return a number.
